"""
This package converts mintmod-flavoured LaTeX into other formats.

It can be seen as a shim for ``mintmod.tex``. It handles important mintmod
commands translating them to regular Pandoc elements. The central part in
this package is
:class:`MintmodFilterAction
<innoconv.mintmod_filter.filter_action.MintmodFilterAction>`.
